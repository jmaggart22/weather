# weather
I have been thinking about creating some type of weather app. I might work on it at some point. This will give you the current temperature and the forecast. I'm using the weather.gov API. You don't need a key. It is set to my location, but you can set it to your location by following this guide I found: https://benborgers.com/posts/weather-gov.
